(How many other NFT projects are audited? Sadly not many.)\nNFT Staking As a celebration of the strongest communities in crypto, the DoE NFTs can be staked to earn $renDOGE and $SHIBA, $DOE for a short period. (Each deposited NFT will equal one share in this limited time pool). Learn about the companion $DOE token.\nFair Launch Launch date will be revealed publically, each participating address can only claim up to 20 of the 10,000 Dogs of Elon. At the end of the presale your NFT and its metadata will be revealed, so everybody has a fair chance to get something cool and rare.\n$DOE the powerful ERC20 that fuels the ecosystem. $DOE is a community-focused, DeFi cryptocurrency token, and the companion to the Dogs Of Elon NFTs. $DOE can be staked to passively earn more $DOE, renDOGE and $SHIBA\nToken Saftey To ensure saftey we have had the $DOE token contract and the Dogs Of Elon NFT contract audited by CertiK. The $DOE contract doesn't contain any potentially hazardous code like mint functions, i.e. The supply is fixed at 1,000,000,000 $DOE. Further more, once we have deposited staking rewards in the the pools we will renounce ownership of that contract, ensuring rewards cannot be withdrawn or the reward modified.", "smart_contract": [["0xd8cdb4b17a741dc7c6a57a650974cd2eba544ff7", "ETH"], ["0xf8e9f10c22840b613cda05a0c5fdb59a4d6cd7ef", "ETH"]], "url": "https://dogsofelon.io/?utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website"}, "Dragonereum": {"dapp_id": 5, "name": "Dragonereum", "chain": "ETH", "category": "Games", "balance": "$3.26k", "users": "2\n\u2014", "volume": "$0", "imageUrl": "https://dashboard-assets.dappradar.com/document/1268/dragonereum-dapp-games-eth-logo-50x50_2712016fa09bc9aec021d18c44c544f0.png", "social": ["https://www.twitter.com/dragonereum/", "https://discordapp.com/invite/WcGYHPX", "https://t.me/dragonereum", "https://medium.com/@dragonereum", "https://www.instagram.com/dragonereum/"], "description": "Description\nWhat is Dragonereum?\nDragonereum is a cryptocollectible game whereby users can own a dragon, trade their dragons, interbreed them and battle other dragons, collecting rewards and achievements along the way.

Farming staking contract. This contract holds 6% of the total XFL supply of 21B tokens. This smart contract will distribute XFL to community members who stake USDC, BUSD, DAI, MIM, LINK, MATIC, FTM, AAVE, or SUSHI.\nThe Yield Farming Pool will run for 25 epochs, each epoch will last 1 week. 50.4M XFL tokens will be distributed in each epoch. If you participate in the Yield Farming Pool, you will be able to harvest your yield at the end of each epoch. Your harvest will be based on the number of assets that you have staked relative to the total number staked in the pool. The calculation will be time-weighted to promote true and fair pro-rata harvesting.\nAfter you harvest your spoils, migrate to new fertile soil in part 2: The Liquidity Provider Subsidy Program. The concept behind the Liquidity Provider Subsidy Program is to reward long-term liquidity providers with progressively more XFL tokens as they continue to signal their belief in the Flame vision. We use the SushiSwap USDC/XFL LP token as a means to reward liquidity pool providers with a massive incentive to bootstrap token liquidity. The program will run for 100 epochs and each epoch will last 1 week. At the end of the epoch, the user can harvest their XFL. This initiative will be granted 4,200,000,000 XFL and each epoch will have 42,000,000 XFL to start.\nIn our 3rd pool, stake XFL for XFL: We want to give early adaptors and long-term believers a mechanism where they are rewarded for hodling XFL, signaling their belief in the Flame vision. Pool 3 is also designed for \u201cthe little farmers\u201d, and the \u201ccausal buyers\u201d.

The new AMM is capable of keeping most of the slippage revenue in the pool by maintaining virtual balances for different swap directions. When a swap happens, a market maker does not automatically apply the invariant algorithm and displays the new prices for upcoming trades. The AMM improves exchange rates for arbitrage traders slowly, over approximately a 5-minute time period.

RTFKT uses the latest in game engines, NFT , blockchain authentication and augmented reality, combined with manufacturing expertise to create one of a kind sneakers and digital artifacts. RTFKT is known to be creating viral sneaker designs, memes and collectible exclusives. RTFKT has maintained a reputation of being more than a little ahead of the cutting edge of technology, a rep that has many mystified, as they would appear to lack the resources and manpower to rival giants in terms of research and development in the birth of digital fashion. Rumours around a rogue AI (stolen from the Space X) used by RTFKT to create next generation designs are completely false and denied by RTFKT. There has been absolutely no evidence or legal action to justify these rumours. For many years, RTFKT was an undefined collective, working strictly in the shadows, providing designs and concepts to game companies and a few select fashion brands, in 2020 they formed an entity to expand their services into the public metamarket. The response has been excellent, and RTFKT\u2019s social growth has been almost frightening.

It achieves a lower gas fee without using layer2 and ensures composability.\n2 Single pool supporting multiple stablecoins with better liquidity\nUnlike Curve, which supports up to 4 stablecoins in one pool, Smoothy can support multiple stablecoins in one single pool, and can flexibly add/remove any token. Theoretically, Smoothy can accommodate hundreds of different types of stablecoins in one pool (even algorithm stablecoin). This means that Smoothy will not suffer from the fragmented liquidity of multiple pools, enabling better liquidity.\n3 Maximum LP reward\nWith reference to the bank\u2019s reserve system, we designed a unique Dynamic Cash Reserve Algorithm, which dynamically allocates the majority of funds in the underlying interest-earning platform and the rest is reserved to meet daily swap needs. In other words, in addition to governance token earnings, liquidity providers can gain swap fees together with interest earning and lower gas fee.\n4 Zero-slippage swapping algorithm\nSmoothy develops a SmoothSwap algorithm that can guarantee 1:1 ratio swap most of the time if the percentage of the token in the pool is lower than soft weights; if not, a swap is still allowed by imposing a penalty fee as slippage.", "smart_contract": [["0xe5859f4efc09027a9b718781dcb2c6910cac6e91", "ETH"]], "url": "https://smoothy.finance/?utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website#/swap"}, "Sora's DreamworId": {"dapp_id": 14, "name": "Sora's DreamworId", "chain": "ETH", "category": "Collectibles", "balance": "$1.31", "users": "2\n-66.67%", "volume": "$0", "imageUrl": "https://dashboard-assets.dappradar.com/document/9942/sorasdreamworid-dapp-collectibles-ethereum-logo-50x50_c9dc744f43d70764b8f053205e036dfc.png", "social": ["https://twitter.com/Sorasdreamworld", "https://discord.com/invite/yVu7uWzmmy"], "description": "Description\nWhat is Sora's DreamworId?\nThere will only be 10,000 Genesis Dream Machines that will ever be created, each and every one uniquely generated on the blockchain.

They struggled to rebuild while enduring radiation storms, famines, droughts, and a devastated atmosphere. They were toughened by the struggle, and, for a time, they survived.\nBut the cities never stopped burning. Radiation rode the smoke plumes into the stratosphere for years. Rads coated the farmlands. The rivers. The tundra. The oceans. Civilization retreated and retreated until there was nowhere to go but the underground.\nThe surface died.\nYears went by. Mammoth machines carved tunnels under the remains of the old nations and a new era of humanity began, but it couldn\u2019t last long. There was plenty of water, but not enough food or fuel for so many survivors. Life could not thrive in the darkness.\nHumanity needed a miracle.\nWhen the drilling machines punched through to existing chambers deep underground, scientists discovered an ancient technology that offered the hope they sought. The giant vaults were empty except for countless people-sized bore holes on the stone floors.\nWho built them? Why were they there? When were they last used?\nThe dwindling number of survivors set forth to discover those secrets before their time ran out.", "smart_contract": [["0x08f0b2a4351514e63e9e03a661adfe58d463cfbc", "ETH"]], "url": "https://www.theprojecturs.com/?utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website"}, "TimeWarp": {"dapp_id": 18, "name": "TimeWarp", "chain": "ETH", "category": "DeFi", "balance": "$38.07M", "users": "1\n\u2014", "volume": "$0", "imageUrl": "https://dashboard-assets.dappradar.com/document/7553/timewarp-dapp-defi-ethereum-logo-50x50_86f6af50092651609e3a92d48d3ea716.png", "social": ["https://twitter.com/ChronotechNews", "https://www.facebook.com/ChronotechNews", "https://chrono.tech/blog", "https://discord.gg/sR74ewkPuG", "https://t.me/chronotech", "https://www.youtube.com/c/ChronoTech/videos"], "description": "Description\nWhat is TimeWarp?\nThe Chrono.tech ecosystem consists of a suite of blockchain products and services. 100% of the revenues generated by these will be used to buy back TIME and distribute it to users who stake their tokens.", "smart_contract": [["0xa106dd3Bc6C42B3f28616FfAB615c7d494Eb629D", "ETH"], ["0x55c825983783c984890bA89F7d7C9575814D83F2", "ETH"]], "url": "https://timewarp.finance/?utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website"}, "Token Batchsender": {"dapp_id": 19, "name": "Token Batchsender", "chain": "ETH", "category": "Other", "balance": "$21.1k", "users": "1\n-75.00%", "volume": "$39.71", "imageUrl": "https://dashboard-assets.dappradar.com/document/5285/ethbatchsend-dapp-other-ethereum-logo-50x50_440012e99fa3e9e0b0c6a30ab189b00e.png", "social": [], "description": "Description\nWhat is Token Batchsender?\nproblem: Previously, in the Ethereum network, additional tools were needed to send many ERC20 tokens at the same time.
