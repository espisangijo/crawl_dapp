All order information is stored onto the Ethereum blockchain instead of a centralized server, which reduces risk for downtime and third-party interference. The decentralized order books interact and execute with complete autonomy through an independent eco-system, assuring full transparency, efficiency and the security level inherent to the Ethereum blockchain for all involved parties. The BitVerk pioneering technical approach brings several important advances within the blockchain based swap protocol domain. A plethora of technical innovations are implemented towards unmatched user quality of experience and value-added services, e.g., fully decentralized spot and leveraged spot swap operations with real-time order matching, deduction of swap fees and collecting ecosystem. Combined with the lack of centralized order-storing servers, BitVerk ensures not only low initial capital expenditures (CAPEX) but also minimal operating expenditures (OPEX), given no associated maintenance cost for physical hardware over time.
