PureFi provides compliance tools (AML, KYC) through Verifiable Credentials & Self Sovereign Identity to protect entities and investors against dirty money risks while interacting with DeFi projects. We will enable institutional investors to participate in a growing DeFi sector through these needed sets of tools.   *PureFi doesn\u2019t break the decentralization principle. Instead, we focus on maintaining the anonymity of users. *DeFi projects (DEXs, liquidity pool operators, IDO platforms) are enabled to filter all incoming transactions with illicit or high-risk assets and evaluate risk score interacting with each wallet. With the same principle, AAVE already launched an institutional liquidity pool with KYC and AML, showing the trend for such services and institutional needs. *Users are incentivized to use PureFi to protect themselves ahead of future regulation.  *Relationships with several AML and KYC providers who, ahead of time, signed up to provide services and analytics for our users when the protocol is launched.  *Technical and strategic partnerships with Hacken, Arcadia Group, and Casper Labs. *Protocol architecture is designed to direct user interaction with 3rd party providers off-chain to maintain low transaction costs. *Massive interest from TradFi entities (traditional hedge funds, banks) to become customers and users of the platform, highlighting and validating the need for such service. *No toxic investments approach (no-flippers)", "smart_contract": [["0xcDa4e840411C00a614aD9205CAEC807c7458a0E3", "ETH"]], "url": "https://purefi.io/?utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website"}, "Put Your Text": {"dapp_id": 8, "name": "Put Your Text", "chain": "ETH", "category": "Other", "balance": "$0", "users": "0\n\u2014", "volume": "$0", "imageUrl": "https://ui-avatars.com/api/?background=214455&color=fff&length=1&name=Put%20Your%20Text", "social": ["https://twitter.com/textblockchain"], "description": "Description\nWhat is Put Your Text?\nPut your message on the blockchain, forever", "smart_contract": [["0x631c0d6f503c900e969c14d80a61d94e34cb0899", "ETH"]], "url": "https://putyourfuckingtextonthefuckingblockchain.com/?utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website"}, "Pyra - Arteon": {"dapp_id": 9, "name": "Pyra - Arteon", "chain": "ETH", "category": "Other", "balance": "$0", "users": "0\n\u2014", "volume": "$0", "imageUrl": "https://dashboard-assets.dappradar.com/document/6580/pyraarteon-dapp-other-ethereum-logo-50x50_979ac9939d7d3ad76f76828f9cb39f79.png", "social": [], "description": "Description\nWhat is Pyra - Arteon?\nBest Dapp rise again and this time comes with a new Token named ARTEON.

Our latest release features an enhanced user experience and is designed to allow individuals to run a node without needing to be whitelisted by Quantstamp. Anyone interested in running a node just needs to follow these instructions. Staking Anyone can now run a node on the Quantstamp Security Network V2 and earn QSP tokens by staking and participating in the network. This greatly increases the decentralization of the network compared to the whitelisted nodes of V1. Quantstamp Security Network V2 also removes the AWS dependencies of the previous version. Nodes can now interact with the Ethereum blockchain directly either using Infura or through their own Ethereum nodes. Improved Analysis Quantstamp Security Network V2 nodes now integrate both Mythril and Securify smart contract analyzers. Together, these two state-of-the-art analyzers allow the network to detect a wide range of common errors and vulnerabilities. Reports on the Blockchain Results of security scans are now stored directly on the blockchain, publicly viewable by anyone - even those who didn\u2019t run the scan themselves. Before, users had to trust that developers took appropriate security measures when developing software. Now, users can independently verify that developers achieved a certain security standard. Open-Source The Quantstamp Security Network V2 code is now fully open-sourced, providing increased transparency. Anyone can now explore Quantstamp\u2019s Github\u2019s protocol and node repositories to check that the Protocol works as expected. As an open source project, the community is also welcome to contribute to the codebase in order to increase or improve functionality. Live Network Statistics Quantstamp Security Network V2 features a redesigned UI with live network statistics and a graphical tutorial. Live stats on node status, network events, scans, and more make it easy to see the status of the network. The UI is also redesigned to be easy enough for non-developers to use. Anyone, from a developer wanting to check draft code for bugs, to a dApp user wanting to make sure the blockchain application they\u2019re using is free from vulnerabilities can use Quanstamp Security Network V2 to easily perform smart contract security scans.", "smart_contract": [["0x74814602062af64fd7a83155645ddb265598220e", "ETH"], ["0x99ea4db9ee77acd40b119bd1dc4e33e1c070b80d", "ETH"]], "url": "https://protocol.quantstamp.com/?utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website"}, "Quarashi Network": {"dapp_id": 24, "name": "Quarashi Network", "chain": "ETH", "category": "Other", "balance": "$0", "users": "0\n\u2014", "volume": "$0", "imageUrl": "https://dashboard-assets.dappradar.com/document/7855/quarashinetwork-dapp-other-ethereum-logo-50x50_29a2c8217c80a1198e780318d08ffb18.png", "social": ["https://twitter.com/QuarashiN/media", "https://www.facebook.com/Quarashi-Network-101478615449502", "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5343987.0", "https://github.com/quarashi-network/", "https://t.me/quarashinetworkofficial", "https://quarashinetwork.medium.com/", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0AZmP1lAMjFg8mud10gw5g/videos", "https://www.reddit.com/user/Quarashinetwork", "https://quarashi.network/top-15-reasons-why-you-should-use-quarashi-chat-app/"], "description": "Description\nWhat is Quarashi Network?\nQuarashi Wallet is the #1 all in one crypto wallet that allows you to secure, manage, and exchange your favorite cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, AAVE, Compound, Tether, and many more.

But wait, unlocking the vault is the easy part of the heist.  Finding the right exit is where it gets tricky.  The bank vault has 50 exits, but only one exit takes you out of the bank and to safety.  All other exits are guarded with highly dangerous drones that will shoot at anything that walks through those doors.  As the locksmith creates more keys and more doors have been tried, both the locksmith and robber will gain very important insight making each heist more possible as time goes on.  Everything is in the hands of the key-holder.  Do you have what it takes to rob the bank?", "smart_contract": [["0xc352a761da01fa8c05f5a83cd07cc3237054e42e", "ETH"], ["0xb1f40bdd1a17429cea058719b9dd4a271a5a51b2", "ETH"], ["0x00edca4652f6e117c0c1f04f2280a86ae08bdd0c", "ETH"], ["0xe67e6e677d272a087a3828209e21fe62fe8d4881", "ETH"], ["0x119ea7f823588d2db81d86cefe4f3be25e4c34dc", "ETH"], ["0x28dd611d5d2caa117239bd3f3a548dce5fa873b0", "ETH"], ["0xd0955bd45d5eef5bedce84a3471c825288a14b01", "ETH"], ["0xdc5aa009ddbe08e904a980b0892ab153dc3f45e3", "ETH"], ["0x01e13ae1ee71234964c4b1118d97db1de4efb632", "ETH"], ["0xd0de1653088554478aec24814b3790f500de90b9", "ETH"], ["0x7c5249ca4de547d388c056139043e876963b1633", "ETH"], ["0x51e9244bae3fca7473fe48651dfd7db53aa55856", "ETH"], ["0xb9dad061b4ada5825abc2c9914e89181c0cdc56c", "ETH"]], "url": "https://retroblock.io/?utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website"}, "Revenants by Alethea AI": {"dapp_id": 19, "name": "Revenants by Alethea AI", "chain": "ETH", "category": "Collectibles", "balance": "$41.9k", "users": "0\n\u2014", "volume": "$0", "imageUrl": "https://dashboard-assets.dappradar.com/document/10158/revenantsbyaletheaai-dapp-collectibles-ethereum-logo-50x50_eed67ab05e197cd3048c075ebc88fd2d.png", "social": ["https://twitter.com/real_alethea", "https://discord.com/invite/aletheaai", "https://medium.com/@arikhan", "https://t.me/alethea_ai"], "description": "Description\nWhat is Revenants by Alethea AI?\nThe Revenants are the world's first Intelligent Collectibles.\nOne hundred intelligent NFTs (iNFTs), depicting historical and cultural icons, reborn.

It\u2019s the forefront of innovation and a mega priority for every major enterprise in our current world.\nWHO ARE THE SOLDIERS IN THIS ARMY\nWith all of this incredible innovation being built, it is only appropriate to introduce a military, ready to defend the Metaverse at all costs -- our soldiers. As the pioneering #MetaArmy, these soldiers will be on the front lines of the future. Each soldier is randomly generated from over 150 traits. Each one is unique and the owner owns a share in copyright/licensing opportunities like action figures, merch and even screen time. This will be the strongest & richest army the \u201cold\u201d world has ever seen.
