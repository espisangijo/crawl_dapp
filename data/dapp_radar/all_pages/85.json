The trust lies with the smart contract and the way that it is coded. Ether Treasury is developed to bring revolution in the field of decentralized cryptocurrency finance.\nNow question is why should investors go for Ether Treasury? As we can see there are many decentralized cryptocurrency finance system exists all over the world, Ether Treasury is one of its type. Because, it provides smart contract that handles multiple ERC-20 tokens along with Ethereum. Also, If we look at the price of most cryptocurrencies they all have supply/demand based pricing models. So when more people buy the crypto the price goes up and when more people sell, the price goes down. This price is usually determined by centralized exchanges that are susceptible to wash trading and price manipulation.

How It works\nEthPire is a DeFi Community oriented project that enables users to place Ethereum on the EthPire Contract, which gives them PIRE as collateral in return. For the time that anyone leaves their Ethereum on the contract the users will all enjoy immediate dividends on every exchange into and out of the smart contract, as well as on any transfer made on EthPire. Any action on the Contract pays dividends to the Users. The Project has been launched and it can not be stopped or tampered with. Its all done by one Smart Contract developed code on the blockchain that knows what to do when you or others interact with it.\nEvery time someone enters the community driven fund, 15% of the incoming ETH are split proportionally amongst all users in the contract. Every time PIRE is transferred, the community receives dividends off the transfer. When someone decides to Exit the contract, another 15% of that is immediately shared to all users in the Community. With every Buy in, the price increments by 0.0000001 ETH and with every sell it decreases by the same factor, for everyone, without exception. Its truly decentralised. Once you have entered into the contract you may also use your reflink to earn 3% commission, only direct and only if the link is used, no more levels.", "smart_contract": [["0xA8dfe9318171244F6b2a3a89F9DF97dFa83D4927", "ETH"]], "url": "https://www.ethpire.com/account?ref=0xcD2B3C517D3De4F962dc01700dc57960CDbeB5E9&utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website"}, "ETHpixel": {"dapp_id": 20, "name": "ETHpixel", "chain": "ETH", "category": "High-Risk", "balance": "$0", "users": "0\n\u2014", "volume": "$0", "imageUrl": "https://dashboard-assets.dappradar.com/document/1539/ethpixel-dapp-high-risk-eth-logo-50x50_d47d55e5b07edfb32534741e05090b6c.png", "social": ["https://t.me/ethpixel"], "description": "Description\nWhat is ETHpixel?\nETHpixel is a collaborative pixel art game running on the Ethereum network, inspired by two successful reddit experiments, the Reddit Place and The Button.

The coin with the most votes wins. More often then not, coin developers/project leaders pay for voting bots or dishonestly encourage the community to vote on their project. Holding votes on a blockchain allows for votes to be protected from voting bots via Ethereum's protocol (specifically gas transaction fees), this also eliminates the incentive for uneducated users to vote since each vote will cost a small amount of Ether and each voter can only vote once.

Ethskytrix is a unique system, being the first of its kind in the ethereum blockchain matrix system to be backed by a functional token, the ETHSKYTRIX TOKEN (ESKT) By participating in the system, you earn ethereum across the matrix structures with a compensatory (ESKT) token allocated to members upon account activation and completion of each system level. The allocated Ethskytrix Token (ESKT), a compensation exclusively reserved for the active participants can be withdrawn and traded on the exchange with high liquidity values. HOW DOES IT WORKS? The ETHSKYTRIX platform is automated with the ethereum blockchain system to prevent third party or admin handling of funds, as funds are directly sent to participants without having the need to opt for withdrawal from the system as the system stores no fund. HOW TO ACTIVATE ETHSKYTRIX ACCOUNT To have your account activated, kindly sign up at https://ethskytrix.live Fund your ethereum wallet with 0.05eth using any certified dapp ethereum wallet(metamask, coinbase, tokenpocket etc) Activate you account by transferring 0.05eth to the ETH wallet account automatically generated by clicking the activation button.

Profits that are generated from the ecosystem feed back to GRO through buybacks, burns, staking rewards, and treasury growth.\nWHEAT \ud83c\udf3e\nWheat is Growth DeFi's yield optimizer and also the name of its incentive token which is designed to be deflationary. WHEAT uses a portion of its revenue from fees to buy and stake major tokens across its chains (e.g. CAKE and BANANA on ApeSwap; AVAX/JOE, ETH, BTC on Avalanche). These are called Exponential Buyback Collectors (EBCs). The EBCs then use only the yield earned from these staked tokens to buy back and burn WHEAT.  The principal is never touched, which means EBC buybacks/burns of WHEAT grow like a snowball, only getting larger. Wheat's Hybridge also burns a large portion of WHEAT when it moves to a new chain. When WHEAT buybacks/burns surpass WHEAT emissions, then WHEAT will become deflationary. Wheat was audited by a top-tier auditor, and the creator of Metamask, ConsenSys Dilligence.\nMOR \ud83d\udcb0\nMOR is our lending/borrowing platform that surpasses all other lending/borrowing platforms in capital efficiency and user profit. MOR is also the name of our overcollateralized stablecoin. It is a fork of Maker's DAI with an added change that allows users to use yielding assets such as LP\u2019s and Single assets as collateral to take out a loan. MOR allows people to leverage their farming tokens. On MOR on Avalanche, users can take 0% or even negative interest rate loans (that means that the loan pays the the user) and the loan becomes self-repaying.
