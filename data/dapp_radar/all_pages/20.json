We worked to create a CryptoPunks alternative that represented us, the meme coin hodlers. We have all witnessed the power of the meme coin community and its ability to consistently defy the experts. In celebration of the meme coin kings we have created 10,000 unique NFTs featuring everybodies favourite K-9, with special sub collections containing 30 unique Elons and 70 zombies Doges.\nTo ensure the safety of the community, we took the extra step to get our contracts audited by CertiK. (How many other NFT projects are audited? Sadly not many.)\nNFT Staking As a celebration of the strongest communities in crypto, the DoE NFTs can be staked to earn $renDOGE and $SHIBA, $DOE for a short period. (Each deposited NFT will equal one share in this limited time pool). Learn about the companion $DOE token.\nFair Launch Launch date will be revealed publically, each participating address can only claim up to 20 of the 10,000 Dogs of Elon. At the end of the presale your NFT and its metadata will be revealed, so everybody has a fair chance to get something cool and rare.\n$DOE the powerful ERC20 that fuels the ecosystem. $DOE is a community-focused, DeFi cryptocurrency token, and the companion to the Dogs Of Elon NFTs. $DOE can be staked to passively earn more $DOE, renDOGE and $SHIBA\nToken Saftey To ensure saftey we have had the $DOE token contract and the Dogs Of Elon NFT contract audited by CertiK. The $DOE contract doesn't contain any potentially hazardous code like mint functions, i.e. The supply is fixed at 1,000,000,000 $DOE. Further more, once we have deposited staking rewards in the the pools we will renounce ownership of that contract, ensuring rewards cannot be withdrawn or the reward modified.", "smart_contract": [["0xd8cdb4b17a741dc7c6a57a650974cd2eba544ff7", "ETH"], ["0xf8e9f10c22840b613cda05a0c5fdb59a4d6cd7ef", "ETH"]], "url": "https://dogsofelon.io/?utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website"}, "Dragonereum": {"dapp_id": 5, "name": "Dragonereum", "chain": "ETH", "category": "Games", "balance": "$3.26k", "users": "2\n\u2014", "volume": "$0", "imageUrl": "https://dashboard-assets.dappradar.com/document/1268/dragonereum-dapp-games-eth-logo-50x50_2712016fa09bc9aec021d18c44c544f0.png", "social": ["https://www.twitter.com/dragonereum/", "https://discordapp.com/invite/WcGYHPX", "https://t.me/dragonereum", "https://medium.com/@dragonereum", "https://www.instagram.com/dragonereum/"], "description": "Description\nWhat is Dragonereum?\nDragonereum is a cryptocollectible game whereby users can own a dragon, trade their dragons, interbreed them and battle other dragons, collecting rewards and achievements along the way.

Farming staking contract. This contract holds 6% of the total XFL supply of 21B tokens. This smart contract will distribute XFL to community members who stake USDC, BUSD, DAI, MIM, LINK, MATIC, FTM, AAVE, or SUSHI.\nThe Yield Farming Pool will run for 25 epochs, each epoch will last 1 week. 50.4M XFL tokens will be distributed in each epoch. If you participate in the Yield Farming Pool, you will be able to harvest your yield at the end of each epoch. Your harvest will be based on the number of assets that you have staked relative to the total number staked in the pool. The calculation will be time-weighted to promote true and fair pro-rata harvesting.\nAfter you harvest your spoils, migrate to new fertile soil in part 2: The Liquidity Provider Subsidy Program. The concept behind the Liquidity Provider Subsidy Program is to reward long-term liquidity providers with progressively more XFL tokens as they continue to signal their belief in the Flame vision. We use the SushiSwap USDC/XFL LP token as a means to reward liquidity pool providers with a massive incentive to bootstrap token liquidity. The program will run for 100 epochs and each epoch will last 1 week. At the end of the epoch, the user can harvest their XFL. This initiative will be granted 4,200,000,000 XFL and each epoch will have 42,000,000 XFL to start.\nIn our 3rd pool, stake XFL for XFL: We want to give early adaptors and long-term believers a mechanism where they are rewarded for hodling XFL, signaling their belief in the Flame vision. Pool 3 is also designed for \u201cthe little farmers\u201d, and the \u201ccausal buyers\u201d.

The new AMM is capable of keeping most of the slippage revenue in the pool by maintaining virtual balances for different swap directions. When a swap happens, a market maker does not automatically apply the invariant algorithm and displays the new prices for upcoming trades. The AMM improves exchange rates for arbitrage traders slowly, over approximately a 5-minute time period. As a result, they will be able to collect only a portion of slippage, while the rest will remain in the pool shared among liquidity providers. This we believe is a game changer.\nHigh competition among arbitrageurs would not allow them to wait for the point at which the price would maximize their profit. By such a delay in price updates, the market maker would create a highly competitive environment for arbitrageurs forcing them to perform trades at less profitable prices, which in turn would add value to the liquidity providers\u2019 side.", "smart_contract": [["0xdf42c6efC7fF03AA1c758EF7F678167f050a884e", "ETH"], ["0xF95b6d2Fb99f742E4Bf0EC2CFE8f20C18cDD7C28", "ETH"], ["0x1B09558388e6Abd10e2D2bF95a45Afe867b2E232", "ETH"], ["0x6094BeD8dd8aB2E58eed0933B34C60928080d4Dc", "ETH"], ["0xE5A6C0421388e4249F10DA95c9094bDe485A885b", "ETH"], ["0xEEc8C042631baac1D3a793D09194d1B2567CA41E", "ETH"], ["0x6D893de7c1088dAB4eeCA93eB41B7a75124Ad9e9", "ETH"], ["0xD6C0121acC2fC8F24A797b46294E13D56913cc54", "ETH"], ["0x3863Fc8C1cC59f160280f5D3E4c1a4C63f945Ce3", "ETH"], ["0xe262F4174b1BeBb2AE18a1D636C077ae7d66beDb", "ETH"], ["0x7A58F682f053074d3333A92362bF1f656b779a25", "ETH"], ["0x334a5d897f1820936Ae532651305672f5F466Bf1", "ETH"], ["0x8dACBF5a8B1eF7580d3C792661EAD4E2B32361E0", "ETH"], ["0xEB94721976095D0b520D3c1028435Fe6f5fa3acD", "ETH"], ["0x83c28F120ff8CB484e799b56FD42343a275004A0", "ETH"], ["0x4433220b44977672dD750B550Ff5ADF279a17d1f", "ETH"], ["0xc38cd6766a825233Af029B6be2865978a37D327C", "ETH"], ["0xff05380251C3B62F76EaA709909Bf733fb339a63", "ETH"], ["0x745B4758D57b149E011A96533B7542b48c11f102", "ETH"], ["0x16CE81CFc20CE5AE4AB57a012E29aC067DEEd501", "ETH"], ["0x841294da345cE764c4628FAca2009a96C373f9eE", "ETH"], ["0x80408A343B2a8E0B847d85a7dCC84562B811914D", "ETH"], ["0xe31605a2E8732D6Eae0a225cebF2cB44b4Fa0eEf", "ETH"], ["0x9B5b9F88D2D8942Dc4a00188c389670CA5425Ed4", "ETH"], ["0xA95A430AA0A1eb12D45f5c888398696Eb01bC369", "ETH"], ["0x3426E78ECC79bf80910a808F1A90202972AFDA43", "ETH"], ["0xdfaC4e58BDF6691562FC5FEc6d9AFC5D8111e076", "ETH"], ["0xFe2f48Cd7E6444c65fdAA2a9aA66e1d9B003A332", "ETH"], ["0x0af7627A2FFf290EFB23a08DfB0648038f911B82", "ETH"], ["0x294c2BAcd8eb7fb74039341ACdCbcd62c7A0A204", "ETH"], ["0xb90d8c0c2ACe705fAD8aD7e447dcf3e858c20448", "ETH"], ["0xbeabeF3fc02667D8BD3f702Ae0bB2C4edb3640cc", "ETH"], ["0xB5ffD0a221Fc94De9255382e70Ce1aec76B68C89", "ETH"], ["0xe435cb6aCa58dc49Bda79753eeD8C0Fa6eD96E5D", "ETH"], ["0x54B45408F40a95B4209d269ab009bbcE9A32A81F", "ETH"], ["0x33440A6139A550CD68BA21cdAFA3241F10041d26", "ETH"], ["0x22A9E3e414E9467d36599c6a8C1BBb59Db5497F0", "ETH"], ["0x0e8F25fD45eEe90733C46853bcc8B05494E10573", "ETH"], ["0x75116BD1AB4B0065B44E1A4ea9B4180A171406ED", "ETH"], ["0x31631b3DD6C697E574d6B886708cd44f5ccf258F", "ETH"], ["0x8C412a045dD7546F7F44FEC5fcaf1f38ca10e66b", "ETH"], ["0x61Bb2Fda13600c497272A8DD029313AfdB125fd3", "ETH"], ["0x44ffa5be7686f8656c5336d39823c34e5d310201", "ETH"], ["0xded57cd84ee0186b3de15ff1a07d06b2f92b0e13", "ETH"]], "url": "https://mooniswap.exchange/?utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website#/swap"}, "Morpher": {"dapp_id": 21, "name": "Morpher", "chain": "ETH", "category": "DeFi", "balance": "$241.31", "users": "2\n+100.00%", "volume": "$0", "imageUrl": "https://dashboard-assets.dappradar.com/document/8391/morpher-dapp-defi-ethereum-logo-50x50_a008e3285ec472ad8fe9fe2e627d77d7.png", "social": ["https://twitter.com/morpher_io", "https://morpher.com/", "https://discord.gg/n8cKG5nSvS", "https://telegram.com/morpher_io"], "description": "Description\nWhat is Morpher?\nMorpher lets you stake crypto against 700+ stocks, commodities, indices, and other currencies.
