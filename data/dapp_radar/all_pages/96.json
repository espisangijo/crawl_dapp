There are NGOs that accept donations in crypto, thus the donations will be transparent and visible on the blockchain. \nOn top of that the environmental impact of each MODC will be stored on the blockchain as well, calculated through ETH prices at the moment of purchase as well as additional donations to the NFT which will increase the impact, backed by scientific papers on how much it costs to remove 1kg of plastic from the ocean. \nHolders and thus members of the Mad Octopus Diving Club will be eligble to: vote on the distribution of donations, receive giveaways like products made out of ocean plastic, participate in impact challenges to win prizes, and many more described in our roadmap.

Therefore, each has a different value. As a matter of fact, the topography, water data, temperature range, and colony conditions are accurate to the extent of human knowledge and from compiling state-of-the-art research.\nMars is finite. Therefore, once the 10,000 cards covering the planet are minted, the only way to acquire one is to purchase it from someone via the marketplace that is embedded in the blockchain. Via this market, you can buy, bid on, and offer cards for sale.\nEach card represents a parcel of land on Mars with unique coordinates. These coordinates are part of the contract and define the unicity of a card. Therefore, and unlike any other NFT project, if for some obscure reasons, the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) would go down, what makes your card unique and distinguishable would still live on the blockchain forever.\nEach new card minted is generated randomly from the pool of remaining parcels. Prices start at 0.15 ETH and increase progressively to 0.5 ETH for the most expensive cards.

Each PAINT token can draw 2 pixels and just like real-life paint, it can only be used to draw once. If it has been used it can\u2019t be taken off of the wall and reused! \nWith only a finite amount of PAINT available globally (there is only enough PAINT to cover the canvas 21,000 times), it is a commodity that encourages artists to produce work they are passionate about as the more PAINT that is used, the less is available.\nOnce an artist has created their piece and \u201cminted\u201d it on the MurAll canvas, it is immortalised forever on the blockchain. The artist receives an NFT (Non Fungible Token) of their drawing; in contrast to traditional tokens, NFTs are one of a kind, ensuring that the artwork is a UNIQUE ORIGINAL which has value and can be kept or sold whenever they wish - just like real-life paintings.

Someone chooses a topic, then randomly auto-generates or manually creates a bunch of NFTs while using some rare and some common traits and that's it.

Instead of offering a pregenerated token set, Niftydudes allows to create your own character based on a set of traits. You want a Niftydude with a specific hairstyle and clothing? Just choose the combination you like and mint him. You can even have different layers. You want your Dude to wear underwear over his pants? No problem. Well, you might ask how trait scarcity is ensured if anyone can just mint a combination they like. Each time a dude is created, a trait is being removed from the list of available traits. Well, not exactly each time, because it can happen that a trait gets selected for removal that has already been removed before. In this case no trait is being removed. This way the removal of traits slows down with every new Niftydude being minted. Using this approach it is impossible to know which of the available traits will be common and which will be rare.

It\u2019s named after Carlos Matos, Most people know him from his introduction in the bitconnect annual party in Thailand, whasso whasso whatsapp bitconneeeect. No Ponzi Carlos Matos The smart contract is essentially a game where earlier participants capitalize on other users who buy, sell, or transfer the tokens. \u201cWhen someone buys or sells NOCM tewken, 20% of the buy at 25% of the sell price is split by the total number of coins and given as locked-in-rewards (priced in Ether)\u201d. At its core, the contract reward system is based on that of a pyramid scheme. By definition, a pyramid scheme is a form of investment in which earlier paying participant recruit new participants, with return being given to early investors using money contributed by newer players. The difference between NPCM and other pyramid schemes, is the fact that the creators of the contract are transparent with the reward system. Since anybody can view the contract, those looking to invest in NPCM should be 100% aware of how the game works. Another way to think of NPCM is a sort of POS model where you receive rewards based on how much of the supply you hold. When a user sells their NPCM for ETH the coins get burned and the supply diminishes, when somebody buys NPCM the supply increases. When a user transfers coins to another address, 10% that transfer get split to all the holders. This reward system might seem confusing, so let me give you an example. If you were to buy into the contract with 1Eth and immediately sell it, you would get around 0.55Eth back. The reason for that is you lose 20% on the buy in, and 25% on the sell, ending up with around 55% of your initial ethereum. In other words, in order to break even the token price has to go up roughly 40% before you decide to sell it. The NPCM website clearly states that this is an entertainment venture rather than an actual investment opportunity. There are no guarantees that anyone will make money from this scheme. Participating in such a game is a risky endeavor, and should be treated as such.", "smart_contract": [["0xd3573c393e3ac2149c52764eaba15d9cda8136dd", "ETH"], ["0x78d4858dd7ce665541e0a0f6e6e68b5da6482273", "ETH"]], "url": "https://noponzi.me/?utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website"}, "NoBull": {"dapp_id": 13, "name": "NoBull", "chain": "ETH", "category": "Gambling", "balance": "$238.58", "users": "0\n\u2014", "volume": "$0", "imageUrl": "https://ui-avatars.com/api/?background=214455&color=fff&length=1&name=NoBull", "social": [], "description": "Description\nWhat is NoBull?\nEthereum smart contract without the BULL.

There are no admin controls or shutdowns built into the code of its smart contract, and all modifications and optimization will be decided by the voting results from community governance.\nAutomated market making (AMM) can calculate the buying and selling price according to the formula, so as to provide continuous quotation for the market. Essentially, AMM is automatic agent and can be realized through smart contracts without human intervention. OneSwap applies the \"constant product market maker formula\" algorithm in AMM, which characterized in the firm liquidity provision to the market no matter how large the order book is or how small the liquidity pool is.\nOneSwap supports on-chain order book. Users can place buy and sell orders at a fixed price. All pending orders are stored in the order book of the blockchain, and the system will conduct transaction matching and settlement in terms of the buying and selling orders. In this way, high security and transparency can be guaranteed. However, all operations like order placing, cancellation, etc. need to be confirmed on the chain, and the transaction speed is affected by the public chain network and the transaction fee paid.", "smart_contract": [["0xEEE21cf8762a87817868039F119e57a7FeC65074", "ETH"], ["0x5eD3C9089Ed0355bc77CF439Dc2eD28c4054C8c4", "ETH"], ["0xF0825577c259aA94728310875368F905aFc57C4F", "ETH"], ["0x28a359cB732bFb74e77D282ACE88e43db28A5F33", "ETH"], ["0x01977983a85804f17835f5eA8232bBd9FBeeaC38", "ETH"]], "url": "https://www.oneswap.net/eth?r=13430211&utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website"}}
