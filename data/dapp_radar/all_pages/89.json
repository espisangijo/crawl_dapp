There are NGOs that accept donations in crypto, thus the donations will be transparent and visible on the blockchain. \nOn top of that the environmental impact of each MODC will be stored on the blockchain as well, calculated through ETH prices at the moment of purchase as well as additional donations to the NFT which will increase the impact, backed by scientific papers on how much it costs to remove 1kg of plastic from the ocean. \nHolders and thus members of the Mad Octopus Diving Club will be eligble to: vote on the distribution of donations, receive giveaways like products made out of ocean plastic, participate in impact challenges to win prizes, and many more described in our roadmap.

Therefore, each has a different value. As a matter of fact, the topography, water data, temperature range, and colony conditions are accurate to the extent of human knowledge and from compiling state-of-the-art research.\nMars is finite. Therefore, once the 10,000 cards covering the planet are minted, the only way to acquire one is to purchase it from someone via the marketplace that is embedded in the blockchain. Via this market, you can buy, bid on, and offer cards for sale.\nEach card represents a parcel of land on Mars with unique coordinates. These coordinates are part of the contract and define the unicity of a card. Therefore, and unlike any other NFT project, if for some obscure reasons, the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) would go down, what makes your card unique and distinguishable would still live on the blockchain forever.\nEach new card minted is generated randomly from the pool of remaining parcels. Prices start at 0.15 ETH and increase progressively to 0.5 ETH for the most expensive cards.
