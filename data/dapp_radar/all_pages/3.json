RTFKT is a very eclectic, creator led organisation. RTFKT uses the latest in game engines, NFT , blockchain authentication and augmented reality, combined with manufacturing expertise to create one of a kind sneakers and digital artifacts. RTFKT is known to be creating viral sneaker designs, memes and collectible exclusives. RTFKT has maintained a reputation of being more than a little ahead of the cutting edge of technology, a rep that has many mystified, as they would appear to lack the resources and manpower to rival giants in terms of research and development in the birth of digital fashion. Rumours around a rogue AI (stolen from the Space X) used by RTFKT to create next generation designs are completely false and denied by RTFKT. There has been absolutely no evidence or legal action to justify these rumours. For many years, RTFKT was an undefined collective, working strictly in the shadows, providing designs and concepts to game companies and a few select fashion brands, in 2020 they formed an entity to expand their services into the public metamarket. The response has been excellent, and RTFKT\u2019s social growth has been almost frightening. The RTFKT project was scheduled to take off in 2040, but the human development in consciousness has accelerated faster than anticipated. We are here to accelerate our digital future now.", "smart_contract": [["0x49cf6f5d44e70224e2e23fdcdd2c053f30ada28b", "ETH"]], "url": "https://www.rtfkt.com/?utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website"}, "Doodles": {"dapp_id": 2, "name": "Doodles", "chain": "ETH", "category": "Collectibles", "balance": "$17.6k", "users": "68\n-2.86%", "volume": "$0", "imageUrl": "https://dashboard-assets.dappradar.com/document/10156/doodles-dapp-collectibles-ethereum-logo-50x50_05d459c36efc4fb1061affacd6b758de.png", "social": ["https://twitter.com/doodles"], "description": "Description\nWhat is Doodles?\nA collection of 10,000 Doodles\nDoodles is a community-driven collectibles NFT project.
