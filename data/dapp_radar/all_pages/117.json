Choose from showing the world a simple link, a clickable image, a video or an iframe to your resource.\nRules are simple: Use ETH to give your publication a score. A publication with the biggest score will be shown on the front page. The longer a publication is on the front, the smaller the score becomes.\nIf a score of the top publication drops below a score of another one, or someone makes a new publication with a bigger score, the latter will take over. A switch will only occur after the former publication was on the front for at least 15 minutes, except for the cases where a score reaches zero before that.\nThe total duration on the front page is calculated by a quadratic function, where 0.05 ETH is equal to an hour and 1 ETH to a day. All publications are kept in the history, where you can see when they were shown and changes in their scores over time. Given the competitive envieronment the dapp also has a leaderboard.\nThe dapp is published to Ethereum Mainnet, Ropsten and Rinkeby and they all have separate histories and leaderboards.
