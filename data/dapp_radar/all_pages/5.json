RTFKT is a very eclectic, creator led organisation. RTFKT uses the latest in game engines, NFT , blockchain authentication and augmented reality, combined with manufacturing expertise to create one of a kind sneakers and digital artifacts. RTFKT is known to be creating viral sneaker designs, memes and collectible exclusives. RTFKT has maintained a reputation of being more than a little ahead of the cutting edge of technology, a rep that has many mystified, as they would appear to lack the resources and manpower to rival giants in terms of research and development in the birth of digital fashion. Rumours around a rogue AI (stolen from the Space X) used by RTFKT to create next generation designs are completely false and denied by RTFKT. There has been absolutely no evidence or legal action to justify these rumours. For many years, RTFKT was an undefined collective, working strictly in the shadows, providing designs and concepts to game companies and a few select fashion brands, in 2020 they formed an entity to expand their services into the public metamarket. The response has been excellent, and RTFKT\u2019s social growth has been almost frightening. The RTFKT project was scheduled to take off in 2040, but the human development in consciousness has accelerated faster than anticipated. We are here to accelerate our digital future now.", "smart_contract": [["0x49cf6f5d44e70224e2e23fdcdd2c053f30ada28b", "ETH"]], "url": "https://www.rtfkt.com/?utm_source=DappRadar&utm_medium=deeplink&utm_campaign=visit-website"}, "Doodles": {"dapp_id": 2, "name": "Doodles", "chain": "ETH", "category": "Collectibles", "balance": "$17.6k", "users": "68\n-2.86%", "volume": "$0", "imageUrl": "https://dashboard-assets.dappradar.com/document/10156/doodles-dapp-collectibles-ethereum-logo-50x50_05d459c36efc4fb1061affacd6b758de.png", "social": ["https://twitter.com/doodles"], "description": "Description\nWhat is Doodles?\nA collection of 10,000 Doodles\nDoodles is a community-driven collectibles NFT project.

The PEAKDEFI fund is a decentralized fund, programmed as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, managed by different Managers in a decentralized, permissionless and smart way to get the best outcome for everybody involved. Investors can invest in the contract and buy a share of the PEAKDEFI fund, whereas managers can participate in on-chain trading with the fund\u2019s capital.\nPEAKDEFI was created to disrupt the whole investment environment. While current solutions have a lot of flaws, especially for small investors and asset managers, PEAKDEFI paves a completely new way by creating one global fund for everybody, transparent to anybody, governed by all together, to reach the PEAK of the Markets.\nBesides investing in the PEAKDEFI global fund, you can grow your capital by staking PEAK. At a very basic level, \u201cstaking\u201d means locking your crypto assets for a certain period of time for a specific purpose. With regard to PEAK, you\u2019ll get rewards for decreasing the current circulating supply in the market and stabilizing the PEAK price by locking your PEAK on the PEAKDEFI platform. 50% of the total PEAK supply, which converts to 1bn PEAK, is reserved for staking rewards. You can earn up to nearly 83% in PEAK Staking per Year!\nSecurity has the highest priority at PEAKDEFI.
