But I hope you'll enjoy mine, Retro Bricks 1982, both retro & modern.\n\nThe beta version here contains 15 test levels, some music and hopefully a lot of fun!\n\nI wish to be able to offer the final version in the next few weeks.

One lapse of concentration is all it takes for an opponent\u2019s guns to line up right outside the starboard window, and if that happens, well\u2026 as they say, a good captain always goes down with the ship.\n\nAdmiral Wars is a VR game for players looking for a brand-new tactical experience that is easy to pick up but difficult to master.

The training is pretty intense, and in a few minutes, you are going to punch many targets and sweat a lot. And if a level is too easy for you, don't worry: you can customize the force required to hit the targets and also the duration of the level to best suit your training needs.\n\nThe game is currently in alpha, and in this free demo, you can play 2 training levels + 8 static workout levels. You can play in AR or VR and even customize your music. We plan to introduce leaderboards, daily challenges, dynamic levels, and much more in a future full release of HitMotion if we get enough funding.\n\nAre you ready for the fitness battle?",

You have sticky hands that automatically attach to any surface so you can climb but also walk on your hands as if they were feet. That makes you like half your usual size, turning you into an agile little climber.\n\nYour every move will be watched by observing full fledged eyes, which are looking for bricks to build their tower with. They need to look at a certain number of same color bricks before they can collect them. You can help them collect or impede their efforts. Working with the eyes will reward you with high scores but you also need to reach coins which are the key to completing the levels.\n\nThe outside world is a dangerous place. Watch out for rats and other enemies that guard collectible power ups and also come out swarming at night.\n\nFeel the action. When you dodge, you dodge. When you run, you run. It's the immersion of actual movement.",

If you do the job well, you are rewarded with another block of the same size. However, if you fail to line up the blocks, the part left outside of the underlying block disappears and the next block you get is smaller. The smaller the blocks, the more challenging it is to stack them.\n\nDespite its simplicity, MoveUp can get highly engrossing. Each time a piece of your block disappears and the next blocks get smaller, you become more absorbed since you see the end of the game getting closer. Fortunately, you can gradually grow back your blocks by landing several perfect landings in a row.\n\nAll in all, MoveUp  is an excellent choice for some casual VR gaming, especially after a long day. Fire it up, get stacking, and put reality on the back burner, even if for a few minutes. You will not regret it. ",

Rico, Maya Sam, and their weird cameraman Albert rolled in an RV to Burningland. The biggest music festival ever. Little did they know, the RV was haunted and the ghost within it started haunting their dreams and altering their reality until they ultimately lose their minds. \ud83d\udc7b\n\nThe Haunted Ride is a campy, spooky and thrilling horror film. It is clean from gore, appropriate for general audiences, and is an epic step in 360 cinema. With spatial sound and endless trippy worlds and nightmares, this movie is a rollercoaster of excitement. \n\nIn this app, you will be able to download all 4 chapters of the VR movie on high quality, for smooth offline playback. Just walk up the stairs, get into the temple, and find the Chapters gates.  ",

Each puzzle must be completed to progress to the next level.

No problem - we help you out with tips to refresh your memory.\n\nThere are three levels:\nFirst, you can practice your understanding of how atoms in a molecule bond. You will create the links between the atoms to form 3D molecules. You can even check if the molecule is stable before proceeding to the next step.\n\nOnce you are done building molecules, you can pick one and apply the VSEPR model to predict the molecule\u2019s geometry. Maybe you know where we are going with this. This is an important first step in being able to predict the molecule\u2019s polarity.\n\nThe last of the exercises is to determine the polarity of the intermolecular bonds and hence, the overall polarity of the molecule. You\u2019ll calculate the force of the vector between each atom as well as its direction.\n\nLook for the tips along the way. This is a fun way to get hands-on experience with all the theory in your textbook.",

In addition, we\u2019ve implemented the processes and procedures of Carolina Biological--America\u2019s leading supplier of science education materials. Using original and lifelike physical models, the dissection experience is recreated to the finest detail and is a comparable substitute for actual live specimen classroom dissections.\n\nSchools can save on expensive and rising annual costs of animal specimens. Additionally, acquisitions are reliable and not dependent on animal procurement. Learning pacing is user-controlled to ensure maximum understanding of the teaching while moving through the program.",

The iconic Highway 1 crosses directly over the mouth of the slough and is vulnerable to flooding at several points where the highway traverses the wetlands. \n\nThis low-lying area will experience rising sea levels and possibly increased storms causing more frequent and intense flooding and eventually permanent inundation by ocean waters. This could impact coastal property, infrastructure, public safety, and access to these amazing coastal resources.\n\nThis experience summarizes the key findings from the Central Coast Highway 1 Climate Resilience Study. We hope it will shed some light on similar planning related to transportation and natural resource issues in face of climate change and sea-level rise.",

To combat bias in ourselves and our communities, we need more than just an intellectual awareness of how others experience the world. The key to real change lies in emotional understanding through empathy. \n\nPerspectives on Bias fosters that empathy through immersive video, letting you feel the impact of bias in the workplace. In the full experience, you explore avenues to combat bias when you see it in the real world. \n\nAre you willing to step out of your comfort zone? To step up and make a difference? \n\nNOTE: This experience is a free demo. To learn more about using a complete Perspectives on Bias experience in your workplace, visit ampcreative.com/perspectives.

The game takes you on 24 meditative journeys through fascinating and soothing environments. Let your breath move you and allow yourself to let go.\n\nFlowborne is created by psychologists with stress reduction and relaxation in mind. It is based on scientific research on stress reduction, biofeedback and virtual reality. An empirically validated algorithm utilizes the hand controller to pick up the subtle respiration-induced abdominal movements. The virtual environment reacts to your breathing in real-time, thus guiding your attention and helping you to perfect your breathing style. Flowborne combines deep relaxation with meditative breathing.",

The ride was developed during Walt Disney's final years, when he repeatedly explored how the tools of filmmaking might be repurposed to explore worlds beyond cinema in his theme park. Adventure Thru Inner Space was groundbreaking not only in introducing the Omnimover and by creating an attraction almost wholly focused on backgrounds (with no characters except for the onboard narration) but in the way it arranged dramatic, themed space toward educational goals.",

In this epic virtual reality game, YOU are the young shepherd boy on a journey to protect your sheep from the dangers of the outside world. You better be quick on your feet because there are lions and wolves and bears nearby! Armed with a simple yet powerful sling, you\u2019ll face challenges around every corner. They are sneaking through green pastures, lurking in the woods, and prowling in caves. If you defeat these foes, then you just might find yourself on the battlefield in the Valley of Ellah. There Goliath has threatened to destroy your family, lands, and nation. IF you can beat him in one-on-one combat, you will save them all. Can you sling your way to victory? Are you a \"mere\" shepherd boy, or are you a GIANT SLAYER? DvG is brought to you by Virtuous VR Gaming and Immersive History.",
